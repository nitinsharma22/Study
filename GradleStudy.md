On CI machines the benefit you can expect from the daemon depends on your setup. If you have long-lived CI agents and you build lots of small projects that all use the same Gradle version and JVM arguments, then the daemon can reduce your turnarounds. If your projects are big or more diverse, you probably wonâ€™t see much benefit. Generally it is safe to leave the daemon on, as Gradle 3.0 introduced health monitoring which will shut daemons down on memory pressure.
